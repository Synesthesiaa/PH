   <p class="de">Bohol is an island province located in the Central Visayas region of the Philippines. It is the tenth largest island in the country and is known for its unique geological features, such as the Chocolate Hills, which are a series of cone-shaped hills that turn brown during the dry season, giving them the appearance of chocolate mounds.

   <br><br> Bohol is also home to a number of historic sites and cultural landmarks, including the 16th-century Baclayon Church, which is considered one of the oldest stone churches in the country, and the Blood Compact Shrine, which commemorates the first treaty of friendship between a Filipino chieftain and a Spanish explorer.
    
   <br><br>In addition to its natural and cultural attractions, Bohol is also popular for its beaches and water activities, such as snorkeling and diving, due to its clear waters and diverse marine life.</p>
