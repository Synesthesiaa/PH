   <p class="de">Batanes is a group of islands located in the northernmost part of the Philippines. It is composed of ten islands, with three inhabited islands namely Batan, Sabtang, and Itbayat. Batanes is known for its scenic landscapes, unique Ivatan culture, and well-preserved traditional stone houses.
<br><br>The islands of Batanes are characterized by rolling hills, rugged coastline, and crystal-clear waters. Tourists can enjoy activities such as hiking, biking, beach hopping, and cultural immersion. Some of the popular tourist spots in Batanes include the Basco Lighthouse, Marlboro Country, Valugan Boulder Beach, and Chawa View Deck.
<br><br>Aside from its natural beauty, Batanes is also famous for its rich cultural heritage.
