                The people of sagada follow a unique burial ritual. The elderly carve their own coffins out of hollowed logs. If they are too weak or ill, their families prepare their coffins instead. The dead are placed inside their coffins (sometimes breaking their bones in the process of fitting them in), and the coffins are brought to a cave for burial.

          One of the most common beliefs behind hanging coffins of Sagada is that moving the bodies of the dead higher up brings them closer to their ancestral spirits. Moreover, people were afraid to be burried in the ground as the dogs would destroy the body and the wet soil would make it quickly decompose.
